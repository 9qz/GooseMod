## FAQ

### Is GooseMod against Discord ToS?

Probably, but not "as bad" as BetterDiscord, etc. as it doesn't directly modify the client's code and files, only adds on top of it via additional JavaScript.


### Can I get banned for using GooseMod?

Similar to the against ToS question, it isn't known. Discord say modifications like BetterDiscord are against ToS yet people are rarely banned because of it. Additionaly, GooseMod is unlike BetterDiscord, etc. as it doesn't directly modify the client's code and files.
