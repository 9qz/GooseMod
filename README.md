# GooseMod (pre-alpha)

### **GooseMod is currently in pre-alpha, only recommended for power users and testers only**

GooseMod is an untethered, unmodifying addition / modification to Discord, injected via DevTools Console. It uses a module system to divide up components so users can individually select what they want.

[You can join GooseMod's Discord here](https://discord.gg/neMncS2)


## Install Guide

As GooseMod is untethered, it is not at all permanent and does not actually modify the Discord client's files or code. The "install" process is actually just activating it until you quit Discord.

1. Clone the GooseMod repo (this) into an easy to access location
2. Copy and paste the contents of the `inspect.js` file into the DevTools console within Discord (accessible via pressing `Ctrl + Shift + I`)
3. Select the modules you want by selecting module files (`<repo>/modules/<modulename>.js`) individually - when you have selected all the ones you want exit the dialog without choosing a file
4. The "install" process should be complete, check the console for any errors that might have happened during it - please give your feedback in the Discord server (linked above)
5. (Thank you for trying it out!)


## FAQ

### Is GooseMod against Discord ToS?

Probably, but not "as bad" as BetterDiscord, etc. as it doesn't directly modify the client's code and files, only adds on top of it via additional JavaScript.


### Can I get banned for using GooseMod?

Similar to the against ToS question, it isn't known. Discord say modifications like BetterDiscord are against ToS yet people are rarely banned because of it. Additionaly, GooseMod is unlike BetterDiscord, etc. as it doesn't directly modify the client's code and files.
