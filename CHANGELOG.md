# GooseMod Changelog

## Version Structuring

GooseMod follows semantic versioning, somewhat. However there are 4 release stages:
 - **Pre-alpha** (current) - Highly unstable, not user friendly at all, unrecommended
 - **Alpha** - Quite unstable, somewhat user friendly, still mostly unrecommended
 - **Beta** - Mostly stable, user friendly, mostly recommended
 - **Release** - Completely stable and recommended, etc. (probably unreachable)

## Pre-alpha v0.1.0
